## File Wrangling Practice Exercises, Part 2

### Getting Started

1. Log onto the server
2. Navigate to the practice directory. You should know where it is from the *Navigating the Filesystem Practice Exercises*!

### Questions

1. How many lines are in the file `README.md`
2. How many comments (lines containing the R comment character '#') are there in the file `analysis/fake_rrbs_analysis.Rmd`?
3. Check the head of `analysis/diff_meth.tsv`. Now, sort `analysis/diff_meth.tsv`. What's different and why might that be a problem?
4. Use cut to display only the chr, start, end, and two methPerc columns in `analysis/count_data_wide.tsv`.
5. Find all of the `ggplot()` lines in `analysis/fake_rrbs_analysis.Rmd`.
