## File Wrangling Practice Exercises

### Getting Started

1. Log onto the server
2. Navigate to the practice directory. You should know where it is from the *Navigating the Filesystem Practice Exercises*!

### Questions

1. Make a file called `practice_file.txt`. Now put a copy of `practice_file.txt` in scripts.
2. `practice_file.txt` doesn't belong in scripts. Move it to the analysis folder
3. It doesn't really belong in the analysis folder either. Make a new directory named `practice` to put `practice_file.txt` in and move it there.
4. Change the permissions on the folder so only you have access to it.
5. These files were just for practice, so we don't need to keep them. Remove `practice_file.txt` and `practice`.
