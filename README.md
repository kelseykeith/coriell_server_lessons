# Coriell Bioinformatics Server Lessons

---

### Getting Started

#### Mac

1. You'll connect to the server through terminal, so you don't need to install any software. I suggest pinning terminal to the dock though. 
2. Download and install XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org/>. This will let you view images from the server.
3. Download and install MacDown <https://macdown.uranusjr.com/>. You'll use this for documenting your work.
4. Download and install Macfusion. Follow the directions [here](how_to_install_macfusion.md).  This will let you transfer files to and from your computer and the server. This is the hardest thing to install, so if it doesn't work come ask for help!
5.  You should already have the Cisco AnyConnect VPN installed on your computer, but if you don't, follow the instructions [here](Cisco_AnyConnect_installation_instructions.pdf). This will allow you to connect to the server from outside of Coriell.

#### PC

1. Download and install PuTTy <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>. This will let you connect to the server.
2. Download and install XMing <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/>. This will let you view images from the server.
3. Download and install Joplin <https://joplinapp.org/>. You'll use this for documenting your work.
4. Download and install WinSCP <https://winscp.net/eng/index.php>. This will let you transfer files to and from your computer and the server.
5. You should already have the Cisco AnyConnect VPN installed on your computer, but if you don't, follow the instructions [here](Cisco_AnyConnect_installation_instructions.pdf). This will allow you to connect to the server from outside of Coriell.
