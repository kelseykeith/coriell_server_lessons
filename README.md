# Coriell Bioinformatics Server Lessons

### Getting Started

#### Mac

1. You'll connect to the server through terminal, so you don't need to install any software. I suggest pinning terminal to the dock though.
2. You should already have the Cisco AnyConnect VPN installed on your computer, but if you don't, follow the instructions [here](Cisco_AnyConnect_installation_instructions.pdf). This will allow you to connect to the server from outside of Coriell.
3. Download and install MacDown <https://macdown.uranusjr.com/>. You'll use this for documenting your work.
4. Download and install Macfusion. Follow the directions [here](how_to_install_macfusion.md).  This will let you transfer files to and from your computer and the server. This is the hardest thing to install, so if it doesn't work come ask for help!

#### PC

1. Download and install PuTTy <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>. This will let you connect to the server.
2. You should already have the Cisco AnyConnect VPN installed on your computer, but if you don't, follow the instructions [here](Cisco_AnyConnect_installation_instructions.pdf). This will allow you to connect to the server from outside of Coriell.
